# CSS-Loaders
This repo copntains few loaders which can be helpful while creating a website. Generally gifs or some kind of video or image has been used to add loaders in the website, which causes slowing down the website and increses overall spacing, Hence loaders made with CSS aren't that heavy or occpy more amount of space when compare to gifs or images.
